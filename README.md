# Pandas Data Manipulation and Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates various data manipulation and analysis techniques using the Pandas library in Python.

## Description

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Series Manipulation:**
    - Creating a Pandas Series.
    - Indexing and slicing a Series.
    - Sorting a Series by index and values.
    - Performing aggregation operations on a Series (mean, sum).
    - Creating a DataFrame from a Series.

2. **DataFrame Manipulation:**
    - Reading data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
    - Exploring the DataFrame (head, tail, columns, dimensions, shape).
    - Accessing elements using `loc` and `iloc`.
    - Adding and removing columns.
    - Adding and removing rows.
    - Setting and resetting the index.
    - Handling missing values (filling with mean, dropping).

3. **Data Aggregation and Transformation:**
    - Grouping data by a column and calculating aggregate statistics.
    - Applying custom functions to DataFrame columns.

4. **Data Merging and Concatenation:**
    - Concatenating two DataFrames.
    - Merging DataFrames using different join types (inner, left, right, outer).

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Navigate to the repository directory.
   - Open the `your-notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

3. **Run the code cells:**
   - Execute the code cells in the notebook to see the results of the data manipulation and analysis operations.

## Datasets

The notebook uses the following datasets:

- `ny_weather-1.csv`: Weather data for New York City.
- `students.csv`: Information about students.
- `professors.csv`: Information about professors.

Make sure to include these datasets in your repository or provide instructions on how to obtain them.
